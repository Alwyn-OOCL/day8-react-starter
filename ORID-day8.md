Bewildered
- Although I have learned some before related knowledge before, I think today's study is still very challenging for me, especially in front end.
# I
- Completely different from back-end learning, I feel a little stressful this afternoon, this let me knowthere is  a lot of room for improvement in the front end for me.  But at the same time, it is also a good exercise opportunity for me to expand knowledge. Hope I can grow from this period.

# D
- More practice in React, turn theoretical knowledge into practical experience
- Ask questions more.
